# Simple HomePod USB / UART Adapter
This is a forked / modified repo of el1ng's and tihmstar's homepod adapters. Almost nothing is changed aside from the README

## You Will Need
* 4x M2x6 screws; to screw the adapter plate to the bottom of the homepod. You can tape it down if it is secure. The point is a SECURE connection. 
* Pogo pins; ones tested working are 1.02mm OD, 15.8mm length, 1.4mmm pin length, 15.8mm total length like these: digikey / mouser link


# Making It
1. Download the .stl file, load it into your preferred slicer, with the homepod side of the dongle facing up, and with support. Then print it!
2. Solder wires to the pins, then insert them into the adapter (otherwise the 3D printed plastic will melt from heat transfer.) Make sure they have a good solder connection, otherwise the USB connection will be very unstable or will not work at all.
3. 



# Warning

If the wrong pins on your adapter touch the wrong pads on the homepod while there is power, it can cause hardware damage. Avoid by simply disconnecting power and usb from pod before removing the adapter from pod.
